# 👋 Hi, I'm Aaron

I'm a full-stack software engineer with a focus on .NET technologies. Currently working on **Electronic Flight Bag (EFB)** software for the aviation industry while completing my **Master's degree**.

---

### 🚀 About Me
- **Current Focus:** Building backend systems for the aviation sector, with a particular interest in system integrations and architecting robust, safety-critical systems.
- **Background:** It all started with **Minecraft plugin development** - from there, it quickly turned into a lifelong passion for solving problems through code.
- **Tech Philosophy:** Writing code that's clean, maintainable, and ultimately makes a difference for the people using it.

### 🌍 Beyond the Code

When I'm not writing code, you'll find me working through a classical piano piece, chasing the right frame on the streets of a new city, or simply exploring somewhere new with a camera in hand.
